# PetStore Application

Full Application Building Process & Deployement described in Root level in the Repo.  [./ReadMe.md](https://github.com/Pandula1234/Pet-Store-API-MiddlewareProject)

These are Some additional instructions for the API Configuration and additional Features for Microprofile.io

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

    ./gradlew quarkusDev

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Creating a native executable

Mind having GRAALVM_HOME set to your Mandrel or GraalVM installation.

You can create a native executable using:

    ./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native

Or, if you don't have [Mandrel](https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel/releases/) or
[GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases) installed, you can run the native executable
build in a container using:

    ./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true

Or to use Mandrel distribution:

    ./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -Dquarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel:20.3-java11

You can then execute your native executable with:

    ./build/petstore-runner

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image.

### Config

Configuration of your application parameters. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config)

The example class **ConfigTestController** shows you how to inject a configuration parameter and how you can retrieve it programmatically.

### Fault tolerance

Add resilient features to your applications like TimeOut, RetryPolicy, Fallback, bulkhead and circuit breaker. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance)

The example class **ResilienceController** has an example of a FallBack mechanism where an fallback result is returned when the execution takes too long.

### Health

The health status can be used to determine if the 'computing node' needs to be discarded/restarted or not. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-health)

The class **ServiceHealthCheck** contains an example of a custom check which can be integrated to health status checks of the instance.  The index page contains a link to the status data.

### Metrics

The Metrics exports _Telemetric_ data in a uniform way of system and custom resources. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-metrics)

The example class **MetricController** contains an example how you can measure the execution time of a request.  The index page also contains a link to the metric page (with all metric info)

### JWT Auth

Using the OpenId Connect JWT token to pass authentication and authorization information to the JAX-RS endpoint. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client)

Have a look at the **TestSecureController** class which calls the protected endpoint on the secondary application.
The **ProtectedController** (secondary application) contains the protected endpoint since it contains the _@RolesAllowed_ annotation on the JAX-RS endpoint method.

The _TestSecureController_ code creates a JWT based on the private key found within the resource directory.
However, any method to send a REST request with an appropriate header will work of course. Please feel free to change this code to your needs.

### Open API

Exposes the information about your endpoints in the format of the OpenAPI v3 specification. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-open-api)

The index page contains a link to the OpenAPI information of your endpoints.

### Open Tracing

Allow the participation in distributed tracing of your requests through various micro services. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing)

To show this capability download [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/download/#binaries) and run ```./jaeger-all-in-one```.
Open [http://localhost:16686/](http://localhost:16686/) to see the traces. Mind that you have to access your demo app endpoint for any traces to show on Jaeger UI.
